# WRA-410-Assignment-3
In working on this project, I used AI to help fix all the little issues I was encountering. I used it to maek sure that I can use certain data from my HMTL so the JS would know what HTML to use

I also used it to make all the css classes to help make it easy to finish all the css I wanted for looks of the simple site

Finally I used AI for some of the JS to make sure I was using the API correctly and to reformatt some of the code, looking at error handling and other things.

Overall, I made a simple site to learn how to make something that can be useful for those in the future, especially making it easy by having 3 options to search based on color.

# I intend to use this as a good example and ideas for my final project for when I do most if not all of it myself.
